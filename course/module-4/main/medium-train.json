Unfortunately, many production projects require you to use Poetry or Docker. That is where things get more complicated.That is why I am writing this article as a practical living document showing how to install these 2 beasts in all possible ways.This tutorial is a living document that I plan to use to install PyTorch & CUDA myself. Thus, I will update this doc whenever I test something I like. Also, in the comments section, feel free to add any other methods you use to install torch & CUDA or troubleshoot potential issues. Let\u2019s create the go-to document that makes installing PyTorch & CUDA a piece of cake!Important observation: I am mainly using Ubuntu. Thus, I will use concrete examples based on it. But this article can easily be extrapolated to other operating systems.Another important observation: I have used Python 3.10, torch 2.0.1 and CUDA 11.8 in most examples. Feel free to change it with your required versions.

These concepts and methods provide the tools and techniques necessary for analyzing and interpreting data, making informed decisions, and communicating results effectively.In this blog, we will explore the top 10 most interesting statistical concepts that a data scientist should know.From the Central Limit Theorem to feature selection, these concepts are fundamental to the field of data science and will serve as a strong foundation for any data scientist. Whether you are new to the field or an experienced professional, mastering these methods will undoubtedly improve your ability to extract insights from data and make data-driven decisions.#1. Central Limit TheoremThis theorem states that given a sufficiently large sample size, the distribution of sample means will approach a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the underlying population distribution. This is an important concept in statistical inference, as it allows us to use normal distribution-based methods to make inferences about a population based on a sample.#2. Correlation and CausationCorrelation refers to a statistical relationship between two variables, where an increase or decrease in one variable is associated with an increase or decrease in the other. However, just because two variables are correlated does not necessarily mean that one causes the other. Establishing causation requires additional evidence and experimentation.Create an account to read\u00a0the\u00a0full\u00a0story.The\u00a0author made this story available to\u00a0Medium\u00a0members\u00a0only.If you\u2019re new to Medium, create a new account to read this story on us.Continue in appOr, continue in mobile webSign up with GoogleSign up with FacebookSign up with emailAlready have an account?

Thus, we need tools that can help us navigate our datasets.This tutorial will present how to clean, visualize and understand Computer Vision datasets, such as videos or images.We will be working on a video of the most precious thing in my house, my cat. Our end goal is to extract essential frames from the video that, lately, can be sent to labeling and to train your model. Extracting crucial information from a video is not straightforward because the video properties change constantly. For example, in the beginning, the video is highly static, and starting from the middle there is a lot of action. Thus we need an intelligent way to understand the properties of the video to eliminate duplicate images, find the outliers, and cluster similar photos.GIF from the video of my sassy cat [GIF by the Author].Leveraging FastDup, a tool for understanding and cleaning CV datasets, we will show you how to solve the above-mentioned problems.The End GoalWe will present a tutorial on decoding a video of my sassy cat and extracting all the frames from it as images. We will use FastDup to visualize different statistics over the pictures dataset.The main goal is to remove similar/duplicate images from the dataset. In the next section, we will detail why cleaning your dataset from duplicates is crucial.

I don\u2019t usually write about this topic, but it contains valuable information that everybody should know.Disclaimer: I am not a biotech expert, but I am an enthusiastic engineer who likes to read about wellbeing, technology, and biotech. Therefore, this summary is my perspective on the book. If you want to get the most out of the book, I highly suggest you read it.Through my notes, I tried to synthesize the main ideas of the book. I overly simplified everything, intending to take practical tips & tricks that we can introduce in our daily lives on how to live longer and happier.Therefore, if, by chance, any expert reads this article, this is a piece of information that ideally can be read by a seven years old child. In my opinion, it is everything we need to know at the level of adding good practices in our daily routine that might keep us healthy to live 100+ years old.Photo of my [1] Lifespan book and its wanna-be index system [Image by the author].Table of Contents:Why Do We Age?Should We Age?Practical Tips & Tricks1. Why Do We Age?Every cell contains a copy of the DNA. We can split the DNA into two logical components:The information that defines us as species,An operating system that can manipulate that information accordingly is called the Epigenome. It has the role of turning on/off specific genes for various cells.The computer is a perfect analogy (at least for me as a machine learning software engineer). When the computer is off, everything is stored on the disk (the DNA). When you turn it on, the operation system (Epigenome) is the first component that wakes up.

Therefore, my life\u2019s mission is simple:1. To always follow my curiosity. I am hooked on the sweet feeling of learning something new daily.2. To build machine learning products that make our daily lives better.Photo of me.My StoryAs a kid, I always loved to break and build stuff. But, I spent my entire childhood playing video games and experiencing to the fullest the story called \u201cadolescence.\u201dWhen I started my bachelor\u2019s degree in SW Engineering, that story finished, and a new one began. A tale that defined, and still does, the current version of \u201cPaul.\u201dThe truth is that before starting my university, I sucked at programming, math, and even writing.I didn\u2019t know exactly if I had the potential to learn software engineering, and I didn\u2019t even know what machine learning was. I was always stuck between \u201cthe cool kids\u201d and \u201cthe nerds,\u201d never being able to find my tribe.My passion for building software started in my second year of college when I participated in my first hackathon. I did not know much about developing complex software applications. Still, I said, \u201cwhat the heck\u201d I want to build a mobile application (more, I want to try). Of course, I didn\u2019t manage to do much. Still, this event sparked my desire to learn more about Java, Python, Object-Oriented Programming, Mobile & Web Development, etc.After a year, I participated in an optional course about Deep Learning. Since then, I have fallen in love with Machine Learning and knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.Long story short, after a few ML jobs, a failed start-up, a master\u2019s degree in Machine Learning, and lots of ML projects, I still feel I have much to learn. But I can proudly say something that, 5 years ago didn\u2019t know was possible: I am a self-thought senior ML engineer, contractor, and content creator.Let\u2019s connect if you want to level up in productionizing ML systems:I post almost daily AI content on \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udcd8 LinkedIn\ud83d\udd8b\ufe0f Newsletter\ud83d\udcbb GitHub\u2709\ufe0f Email\ud83d\udc26 TwitterCreating content takes me a lot of time.

But if you throw away all the fancy math terms, the idea behind the algorithm is easy to understand.After reading this article, you will get an intuition about why and how to use SVD in various applications.I could throw the definition of SVD such as:In linear algebra, the singular value decomposition (SVD) is a factorization of a real or complex matrix. It generalizes the eigendecomposition of a square normal matrix with an orthonormal eigenbasis to any m x n matrix. [1]Hmm. What is that? This definition won\u2019t make any sense for a beginner or a person who isn\u2019t much in math. Many people are coming from software into machine learning engineering and are struggling to understand some of the advanced math concepts used in ML. At least I did.Don\u2019t get me wrong, to fully understand what SVD is, you need to understand the math behind it, but we focused in this article on getting the intuition on how it works and why we even care about SVD. We will not focus on the actual computation of the algorithm.Famous use cases for SVD are:Pseudoinverse \u2014 inverse for matrices of any size (the Moore-Penrose Inverse)Dimensionality Reduction (images, tabular data, etc.)Recommendation engines (the FunkSVD algorithm and its derivatives)The Intuition Behind SVDLet\u2019s reduce the problem to people and their favorite food. We assume we have a m x n matrix A, where m represents the number of people and n is the number of possible food types. The matrix values represent how much a person likes a food type, encoded as a rating from 1 to 10.Here is an example of a 3x4 matrix with three people and four food types:Create an account to read\u00a0the\u00a0full\u00a0story.The\u00a0author made this story available to\u00a0Medium\u00a0members\u00a0only.If you\u2019re new to Medium, create a new account to read this story on us.Continue in appOr, continue in mobile webSign up with GoogleSign up with FacebookSign up with emailAlready have an account?

Image by Author, inspired by source.MLOps is a new field that was born due to the high failure rate of most machine learning projects. By failure, we understand the inability to generalize your freshly cooked model and ship it into a production environment to bring value to a specific group of people. Don't get me wrong, there are many excellent machine learning projects/algorithms, but the main issue is that a few have passed the \"laboratory\" stage of development.As we all know, machine learning addresses problems that cannot be well specified programmatically. Machine Learning systems are entangled with various dependencies, such as the size of the dataset, the distribution of features within the dataset, data scaling and splitting techniques, the type of optimizer being used, etc.Using a standardized end-to-end MLOps framework, we can show our incredible models to the world and show people how impressive AI can be.\u201cReproducibility is a kindness to your future self and everyone else who might want to build upon your work, which is an excellent goal all on its own.\u201d\ud83c\udfc6 This article will summarize the core components used in almost any MLOps infrastructure.

I always heard that the countries in the North of Europe are the happiest in the world. Also, I read about their great culture, people, and tech opportunities (yes, I work in tech). In the end, I said to myself that it would be a great experience to try to live in such a country.My first choice was The Netherlands because it is not that far into the North and I already visited Amsterdam, which I liked a lot. I think it had a great vibe. But before taking the big step of moving there, I would like to visit the country for a longer period to see how I would fit into their culture.Now which is the easiest way to travel around these days? You guessed it, with Airbnb or other similar services like Booking.Therefore, I used the data provided by Airbnb to see what would be the best places to rent. The data can be accessed here. It contains a lot of interesting features. Starting from the price & reviews until its availability, on multiple time ranges, of a listing.Airbnb logo. Source.They provide quarterly data for the last 12 months. At the time I wrote this article their last update was on the 5th of June 2022. Therefore the data spans from 05.06.2021 until 05.06.2022.The analysis will contain the biggest cities in The Netherlands: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and The Hague.Content1\ufe0f\u20e3 Which city has the highest price tag? What about their neighborhoods?2\ufe0f\u20e3 What city and neighborhoods are in most demand?3\ufe0f\u20e3 Are reviews for more expensive houses better?4\ufe0f\u20e3 What are the factors that affect a property\u2019s price?1\ufe0f\u20e3 Which city has the highest price tag? What about their neighborhoods?As we can see in the figure below the most expensive city is Amsterdam. Rotterdam and The Hague are in the same price range.Fig 1: Mean prices per night for the cities.The interesting part comes when we drill down the prices/night in different neighborhoods. In the figure below we can see the cheapest and most expensive neighborhoods. We can see that the prices in Amsterdam don\u2019t vary so much, while in The Hague there are some extravagant neighborhoods you can stay in. Also, if you want to spend as less as possible probably The Hague or Rotterdam is the way to go.Fig 2: Mean prices per night for the neighborhoods.2\ufe0f\u20e3 What city and neighborhoods are in most demand?Fig 3: Demand for the cities.In the figure below we can see that people that are going to Amsterdam tend to stick to the mean price which is ~$160. In Rotterdam and The Hague people either choose more expensive properties, around $160 as in Amsterdam, or cheaper ones under $50.Also, the luxurious properties cost more than $500 per night. As you can see that kind of neighborhood are not in the least in-demand group, suggesting that people are willing to pay that kind of money for a luxurious holiday. The neighborhoods that are least in demand are actually having prices close to the mean price of the particular city.Fig 4: Demand for the neighborhoods relative to their price range. The bars are ordered from the ones with the least to the ones with the highest demand.3\ufe0f\u20e3 Are reviews for more expensive houses better?Well, the answer is yes and no. We can see that the price ranges between $1000 \u2014 $1500 are having the best overall score rating. For this range is a yes. But the really expensive properties, with a range of $1500-$1750, are having the worst performance. Probably people that are booking those kinds of properties are having high expectations or are harder to please.What is good to see is that the lower price ranges of $0\u2013$500 are still having good reviews. Therefore, it is safe to look into that range.Fig 5: USD price range/night relative to their mean review score rating.4\ufe0f\u20e3 What are the factors that affect a property\u2019s price?We can see some obvious factors like the number of accommodates, bedrooms and property type. Also, the neighborhood/location has a clear impact on the price.What is more interesting is that the demand for property dictates its price. This is reflected in the availability of 30, 60, 90, and 365 factors (those reflect the number of days a property was free in a specific period).Also, we can see that the number of reviews and when the last one was written have a high impact. One last, interesting observation would be that the period since the host is on Airbnb influence the price. Probably, because he has more experience.Fig 6: Most important factors that influence the price of a property.ConclusionIn this article, we looked at how to book your favorite Airbnb property in The Netherlands by using their public dataset.We looked at the mean price in the biggest cities. Also, we drilled down on the most & least expensive neighborhoods.We compared which cities and neighborhoods are in the most demand.We compared the review score rating over different price ranges to see if a pricier property is actually better.We made a list of the most important factors that influence the price of a listing.What other factors would you consider when looking for an Airbnb property?If you want to see the code of this analysis you can check out the GitHub repository, which is available here.Thank you for reading my article!Do not hesitate to reach me via the following :Follow me on MediumConnect and reach me on LinkedInWrite me at my mail address: p.b.iusztin@gmail.comSign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of the world.FreeDistraction-free reading.

The most standard way of interacting with a model is to use it in an offline setup, where we have some kind of dataset to play with. This is ok for experimentation and to build your initial model. But, the next step would be to put our precious model out in the wild so people can use it. This is what model serving is all about. It represents the mechanism of deploying the model so other people can interact with it. With model serving, you can move from experimentation to production.The most common ways of serving a model are:Model-as-Dependency;Model-as-Service.\u2699\ufe0f In a Model-as-Dependency setup, the model will be used directly by the application. For example, in a Python project, it will be installed as a package through pip or integrated into your code directly from a git repository. I think this is the easiest way, conceptually, to serve a model, but it comes with some downsides. Where the application runs, you need to have the necessary hardware for your model, which sometimes is not possible. Also, the client of the model will always have to go through the pain of managing the dependencies of the model, which in some cases is a real pain.Model-as-Dependency\u2699\ufe0f In a Model-as-Service setup the model will be accessed through a web API (e.g. RESTful API). In this way, the client can treat the model as a black box. It only has to know the model's inputs and outputs. The rest of the article will explain in more detail how the Model-as-Service works.Model-as-ServiceModel-as-ServiceAs we said the Model-as-Service will be used by its clients through a web API.

What is GitHub CopilotGitHub Copilot is the latest autocompletion tool developed by OpenAI. It uses deep learning to understand your current state of the program. It is more than just a simple auto-completion tool because it can give you complex suggestions based on the whole state of the function/class/program you are into. In some cases, it will suggest you multiple lines of code and sometimes even the whole function.From my perspective, this tool will change the game of programming. We will switch from ctrl-c + ctrl-v to ctrl + tab (this is how you accept a suggestion from the tool).SourceI will not describe how the algorithm works and how it makes the suggestions, because, honestly, I did not have the chance to understand it so far. I will focus just on how to use it and give you some screenshots from my coding session to see it in action.To be honest, I was pretty impressed with what it can do. It can have a deep understanding of your code by making multi-line suggestions and picking up on your coding style.

In the last months, I had the chance to work with some tabular data. I started learning by looking at different solutions on Kaggle. To my surprise almost every solution was based on decision trees based models, more precisely on XGBoost and LightGBM, which are both gradient boosting decision tree methods. To understand XGBoost and LightGBM first you have to understand previous iterations of the algorithm. Therefore, I thought it would be nice to learn everything from one place.In this article, I packed together everything you need to know starting from a simple decision tree until the most known algorithms like XGBoost and LightGBM. I want to give you an intuition on what is a decision tree and how it is optimized. Also, this blog is for people who don\u2019t have a lot of time, but still want to understand the whole thought process starting from a simple decision tree to the most popular models like XGBoost and LightGBM.Table of content:Decision Trees2. Future Approaches Built on Top of Decision Trees3. Gradient Boosting4. XGBoost5. LightGBM1. Decision TreesWhat is a Decision Tree?As shown in Fig. 1 a decision tree is an acyclic binary graph. This translates to a graph where every node has exactly two children and the logic flows in only one direction: from top to bottom (there are no cycles). It has three main components: the node, the root node, and the leaf. A node is a component that contains a boolean condition, the root node is the first node within the graph, and the leaf is the last element within the graph where the flow ends. In our case, the value within the leaf represents the final prediction of the model.Let\u2019s say that we have a person to which we know the height (meters) and country of residence and we want to predict their weight (kg). If its height is 1.75 meters and it lives in Canada then the logic, relative to the decision tree from Fig. 1, will be the\u2026Create an account to read\u00a0the\u00a0full\u00a0story.The\u00a0author made this story available to\u00a0Medium\u00a0members\u00a0only.If you\u2019re new to Medium, create a new account to read this story on us.Continue in appOr, continue in mobile webSign up with GoogleSign up with FacebookSign up with emailAlready have an account?

It needs a GPU to train their models on them or they will grow old until they will see any output out of their beloved project (of course there are cloud options, but for hobbyists, it is not the same as developing on your own PC). But, unfortunately, GPUs are very expensive. Nowadays, all PC components are expensive, but the GPUs are the ones that empty your pockets. This is mostly a by-product of mining cryptocurrencies. So here is the question. Should you hate the darkness or you should join it?The easiest path would be to complain about how expensive those components are and move on with your life. But I decided to join the darkness and build my own mining computer (rig). My goal was to build a workstation with 4 decent GPUs. Sadly, nothing is free in life, but this approach is almost free if you have some patience. You have to own the cash for the components, but the nice part is that you can put them to work. In 10\u201312 months, depending on what GPUs you buy, you can get your money back. Also, depending on what setup you finally want to own/afford, you can invest more/less cash into this idea. Also, it would be really helpful if you have a decent idea of how to build a PC.Now, you would say that mining is degrading your GPU's being worthless after that period of 10\u201312 months. Yeah, that could be true, but not always true. If you are careful on how you overclock your GPUs you can keep them undervolted and at low temperatures, therefore mining being even less harmful than gaming or machine learning.This is my mining setup. I ended up buying 6 GPUs after all, to speed up my process. I have some mid-range GPUs, but as I said the idea can be scaled. A better GPU will generate more money. I am using HiveOS on my mining rig, a Linux distribution that is very efficient for mining:The GPUs status.On the fourth column, you can see the temperatures. As long those numbers are under 70-celsius degrees there is no possible harm. Mine are around ~50. Far from the degrading point.

We usually just buy some specific assets periodically. Often though we get to buy assets when they are at the top of the cycle because we just want to do our monthly finances and don\u2019t want to waste time with any technical analysis. This is fine, but we usually lose some % every month, which over long periods would compound nicely increasing our overall returns.This is where Yacht kicks in. Yacht is a Python package specialized in Order Execution. It is not a trading bot. It is built for the buy and hold investors with the thought to boost their performance. Let\u2019s give an example of how Yacht will be used. We want to invest 1000$ monthly into the SPY ETF. Yacht will listen to the trends of the market in that specific month and tell us when is the best moment to buy. It will also tell us what amount would be best to buy within a specific day. So it will sell nothing, it will just buy a given asset over a month with the idea to buy it below the mean price within that specific month. Long story short, the goal of Yacht is to give you a discount on your favorite assets.Note: The amount of money and the period of one month are just examples. Those can be adjusted to your own needs.This will be a tutorial on how to begin using Yacht. You can see the code on GitHub.Short IntroductionYacht is a Python package. It is a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for the Financial Market. It is modular and flexible so it is easily adjustable to our own needs. It has environments for Trading and Order Execution. It supports data downloading, processing & caching. Also, it has cool features like Wandb integration and renderers to see how your agent is performing. It supports lots of metrics. An app layer can easily be added to build your ideas on top of it. But it is only in the early stages of its development. Therefore, our main focus was on Order Execution.I am the main maintainer of the codebase.

Now we are left with 80% which we have to split into train and validation. The easiest way to go would be just to take another 20% into the validation split and train with 60% of the data. There are two reasons why this would not work:We have too little dataWe could overfit the hyper-parameters on the validation split.Cross-validation is trying to solve those problems. The basic approach is called k-fold CV. The algorithm consists in partitioning the train-validation split into k groups. Afterward, take the first group as the validation split and the rest of k-1 as the training split. We repeat this process until every group has been used as a validation split. For our final metrics, take all the k results and average them together. This method is more computationally intensive, but it helps the algorithm to generalize well even with small amounts of data. In the figure below we can see the visual representation of a 5-Fold CV :5-Fold Cross-Validation Example; sourceNote: In some cases, we only have two splits: train and validation , but the same principles apply.Why does K-Fold Cross-Validation Fail in Finance?The k-fold method usually works with the standard data, but in price time series the main issue is that the observations are not independent and identically distributed ( IID). In simpler terms the features are serially correlated, therefore the labels are derived from overlapping data points.A feature from time t is highly correlated with the feature from\u2026Create an account to read\u00a0the\u00a0full\u00a0story.The\u00a0author made this story available to\u00a0Medium\u00a0members\u00a0only.If you\u2019re new to Medium, create a new account to read this story on us.Continue in appOr, continue in mobile webSign up with GoogleSign up with FacebookSign up with emailAlready have an account?

In this article, I want to give you an intuition on the problem and how to solve it properly without losing you in too many details. If you are interested to dive deep into the topic, I suggest you read: Advances in Financial Machine Learning by Marcos L\u00f3pez de Prado. It is really a great book if you are interested in applying Machine Learning in Finance.A Machine Learning algorithm needs the data to be stationary so it can work properly. Before throwing the definition of stationarity I want to give you an intuition about it. Let\u2019s say that we have the price of an asset over a period of time. The training data has prices that vary within the interval [90$; 100$]. The algorithm will learn that everything that is around 90$ is cheap and everything that is around 100$ is expensive. Because the price of an asset moves its mean price over time, the test split will have the price within [100$; 110$]. Now the algorithm will think that the asset is always expensive, even though that is not true because now 100$ is the lowest point. This will mess with the algorithm and it will probably make very strange predictions.Now let's see the definition of stationarity: A time series has stationarity if a shift in time doesn\u2019t cause a change in the shape of the distribution. Basic properties of the distribution like the mean , variance and covariance are constant over time.As an example, we can see in the figure below the prices of Apple from 2021 to 2022. It doesn\u2019t look very stationary right?Apple prices from 2021 to 2022Also, in this article, I will present to you why the standard integer differentiation is not good enough for memory preservation.Theoretical DemonstrationCreate an account to read\u00a0the\u00a0full\u00a0story.The\u00a0author made this story available to\u00a0Medium\u00a0members\u00a0only.If you\u2019re new to Medium, create a new account to read this story on us.Continue in appOr, continue in mobile webSign up with GoogleSign up with FacebookSign up with emailAlready have an account?
