## Why is this course different?

*By finishing the **"LLM Twin: Building Your Production-Ready AI Replica"** free course, you will learn how to design, train, and deploy a production-ready LLM twin of yourself powered by LLMs, vector DBs, and LLMOps good practices.*

> Why should you care? ü´µ
> 
> ‚Üí **No more isolated scripts or Notebooks!** Learn production ML by building and deploying an end-to-end production-grade LLM system.


## What will you learn to build by the end of this¬†course?

You will **learn** how to **architect** and **build a real-world LLM system** from **start** to **finish**‚Ää-‚Ääfrom **data collection** to **deployment**.

You will also **learn** to **leverage MLOps best practices**, such as experiment trackers, model registries, prompt monitoring, and versioning.

**The end goal?** Build and deploy your own LLM twin.

**What is an LLM Twin?** It is an AI character that learns to write like somebody by incorporating its style and personality into an LLM.

## The architecture of the LLM twin is split into 4 Python microservices:

<p align="center">

</p>

### The data collection pipeline

- Crawl your digital data from various social media platforms.
- Clean, normalize and load the data to a [Mongo NoSQL DB](https://www.mongodb.com/) through a series of ETL pipelines.
- Send database changes to a [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) queue using the CDC pattern.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployed on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

### The feature pipeline

- Consume messages from a queue through a [Bytewax](https://github.com/bytewax/bytewax?utm_source=github&utm_medium=decodingml&utm_campaign=2024_q1) streaming pipeline.
- Every message will be cleaned, chunked, embedded and loaded into a [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/?utm_source=decodingml&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=llm-course) vector DB in real-time.
- In the bonus series, we refactor the cleaning, chunking, and embedding logic using [Superlinked](https://rebrand.ly/superlinked-github), a specialized vector compute engine. We will also load and index the vectors to [Redis vector search](https://redis.io/solutions/vector-search/).
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployed on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

### The training pipeline

- Create a custom dataset based on your digital data.
- Fine-tune an LLM using QLoRA.
- Use [Comet ML's](https://www.comet.com/signup/?utm_source=decoding_ml&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) experiment tracker to monitor the experiments.
- Evaluate and save the best model to [Comet's](https://www.comet.com/signup/?utm_source=decoding_ml&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) model registry.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployed on AWS SageMaker

### The inference pipeline

- Load the fine-tuned LLM from [Comet's](https://www.comet.com/signup/?utm_source=decoding_ml&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) model registry.
- Deploy it as a REST API.
- Enhance the prompts using advanced RAG.
- Generate content using your LLM twin.
- Monitor the LLM using [Comet's](https://www.comet.com/signup/?framework=llm&utm_source=decoding_ml&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) prompt monitoring dashboard.
- In the bonus series, we refactor the advanced RAG layer to write more optimal queries using [Superlinked](https://rebrand.ly/superlinked-github).
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployed on AWS SagaMaker
- Wrap up everything with a Gradio UI (as seen below) where you can start playing around with the LLM Twin.

</p>

Along the 4 microservices, you will learn to integrate 4 serverless tools:

* [Comet ML](https://www.comet.com/signup/?utm_source=decoding_ml&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) as your ML Platform;
* [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/?utm_source=decodingml&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=llm-course) as your vector DB;
* [AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) as your ML infrastructure;
* [Opik](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik) as your prompt evaluation and monitoring tool.
