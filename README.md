## Why is this course different?

*By finishing the **"LLM Twin: Building Your Production-Ready AI Replica"** free course, you will learn how to design, train, and deploy a production-ready LLM twin of yourself powered by LLMs, vector DBs, and LLMOps good practices.*

> Why should you care? 🫵
> 
> → **No more isolated scripts or Notebooks!** Learn production ML by building and deploying an end-to-end production-grade LLM system.


## What will you learn to build by the end of this course?

You will **learn** how to **architect** and **build a real-world LLM system** from **start** to **finish** - from **data collection** to **deployment**.

You will also **learn** to **leverage MLOps best practices**, such as experiment trackers, model registries, prompt monitoring, and versioning.

**The end goal?** Build and deploy your own LLM twin.

**What is an LLM Twin?** It is an AI character that learns to write like somebody by incorporating its style and personality into an LLM.

## The architecture of the LLM Twin is split into 4 Python microservices:

</p>

### The data collection pipeline

- Crawl your digital data from various social media platforms, such as Medium, Substack and GitHub.
- Clean, normalize and load the data to a [Mongo NoSQL DB](https://www.mongodb.com/) through a series of ETL pipelines.
- Send database changes to a [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) queue using the CDC pattern.
- Learn to package the crawlers as AWS Lambda functions.

### The feature pipeline

- Consume messages in real-time from a queue through a [Bytewax](https://github.com/bytewax/bytewax?utm_source=github&utm_medium=decodingml&utm_campaign=2024_q1) streaming pipeline.
- Every message will be cleaned, chunked, embedded and loaded into a [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/?utm_source=decodingml&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=llm-course) vector DB.
- In the bonus series, we refactor the cleaning, chunking, and embedding logic using [Superlinked](https://github.com/superlinked/superlinked?utm_source=community&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=oscourse), a specialized vector compute engine. We will also load and index the vectors to a [Redis vector DB](https://redis.io/solutions/vector-search/).

### The training pipeline

- Create a custom instruction dataset based on your custom digital data to do SFT.
- Fine-tune an LLM using LoRA or QLoRA.
- Use [Comet ML's](https://www.comet.com/signup/?utm_source=decoding_ml&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) experiment tracker to monitor the experiments.
- Evaluate the LLM using [Opik](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik)
- Save and version the best model to the [Hugging Face model registry](https://huggingface.co/models).
- Run and automate the training pipeline using [AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).

### The inference pipeline

- Load the fine-tuned LLM from the [Hugging Face model registry](https://huggingface.co/models).
- Deploy the LLM as a scalable REST API using [AWS SageMaker inference endpoints](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/deploy/).
- Enhance the prompts using advanced RAG techniques.
- Monitor the prompts and LLM generated results using [Opik](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik)
- In the bonus series, we refactor the advanced RAG layer to write more optimal queries using [Superlinked](https://github.com/superlinked/superlinked?utm_source=community&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=oscourse).
- Wrap up everything with a Gradio UI (as seen below) where you can start playing around with the LLM Twin to generate content that follows your writing style.

</p>

Along the 4 microservices, you will learn to integrate 4 serverless tools:

* [Comet ML](https://www.comet.com/signup/?utm_source=decoding_ml&utm_medium=partner&utm_content=github) as your experiment tracker and data registry;
* [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/?utm_source=decodingml&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=llm-course) as your vector DB;
* [AWS SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) as your ML infrastructure;
* [Opik](https://github.com/comet-ml/opik) as your prompt evaluation and monitoring tool.

## Who is this for?

**Audience:** MLE, DE, DS, or SWE who want to learn to engineer production-ready LLM & RAG systems using LLMOps good principles.

**Level:** intermediate

**Prerequisites:** basic knowledge of Python and ML

## How will you learn?

The course contains **10 hands-on written lessons** and the **open-source code** you can access on GitHub, showing how to build an end-to-end LLM system.

Also, it includes **2 bonus lessons** on how to **improve the RAG system**.

You can read everything at your own pace.


## Costs?
The **articles** and **code** are **completely free**. They will always remain free.

If you plan to run the code while reading it, you must know that we use several cloud tools that might generate additional costs.

**Pay as you go** 
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) offers accessible plans to new joiners.
    - For a new first-time account, you could get up to 300$ in free credits which are valid for 6 months. For more, consult the [AWS Offerings](https://aws.amazon.com/free/offers/) page.

## Install & Usage

To understand how to **install and run the LLM Twin code end-to-end**, go to the [INSTALL_AND_USAGE](https://github.com/decodingml/llm-twin-course/blob/main/INSTALL_AND_USAGE.md) dedicated document.

> [!NOTE]
> Even though you can run everything solely using the [INSTALL_AND_USAGE](https://github.com/decodingml/llm-twin-course/blob/main/INSTALL_AND_USAGE.md) dedicated document, we recommend that you read the articles to understand the LLM Twin system and design choices fully.

### Bonus Superlinked series

The **bonus Superlinked series** has an extra dedicated [README](https://github.com/decodingml/llm-twin-course/blob/main/6-bonus-superlinked-rag/README.md) that you can access under the [src/bonus_superlinked_rag](https://github.com/decodingml/llm-twin-course/tree/main/src/bonus_superlinked_rag) directory.

In that section, we explain how to run it with the improved RAG layer powered by [Superlinked](https://github.com/superlinked/superlinked?utm_source=community&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=oscourse).
